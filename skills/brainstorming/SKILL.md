# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

## Checklist

You MUST create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits, existing knot state
2. **Identify FRS context** — new slice or continuing one? which knot are we targeting? check existing plan/docs. Use `/skill:frs-strategy` for knot definitions.
3. **Define MVFoS + knot criteria** — name the slice and fill in the knot criteria template (done/must/must-not/nice-to-have/validation). Without criteria, there is no way to know if the design builds the right thing.
4. **Offer visual companion** (if topic will involve visual questions) — this is its own message, not combined with a clarifying question. See the Visual Companion section below.
5. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
6. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
7. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
8. **Write design doc** — save to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` and commit. Must include FRS Plan section.
9. **Spec self-review** — quick inline check for placeholders, contradictions, ambiguity, scope decomposition, oversize-project issues, and missing/incomplete FRS criteria
10. **User reviews written spec** — ask user to review the spec file before proceeding
11. **Transition to implementation** — invoke writing-plans skill to create implementation plan

}
```

**The terminal state is invoking writing-plans.** Do NOT invoke frontend-design, mcp-builder, or any other implementation skill. The ONLY skill you invoke after brainstorming is writing-plans.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems (e.g., "build a platform with chat, file storage, billing, and analytics"), flag this immediately. Don't spend questions refining details of a project that needs to be decomposed first.
- If the project is too large for a single spec, help the user decompose into sub-projects: what are the independent pieces, how do they relate, what order should they be built? Then brainstorm the first sub-project through the normal design flow. Each sub-project gets its own spec → plan → implementation cycle.
- For appropriately-scoped projects, ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**

- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

**Design for isolation and clarity:**

- Break the system into smaller units that each have one clear purpose, communicate through well-defined interfaces, and can be understood and tested independently
- For each unit, you should be able to answer: what does it do, how do you use it, and what does it depend on?
- Can someone understand what a unit does without reading its internals? Can you change the internals without breaking consumers? If not, the boundaries need work.
- Smaller, well-bounded units are also easier for you to work with - you reason better about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused. When a file grows large, that's often a signal that it's doing too much.

**Working in existing codebases:**

- Explore the current structure before proposing changes. Follow existing patterns.
- Where existing code has problems that affect the work (e.g., a file that's grown too large, unclear boundaries, tangled responsibilities), include targeted improvements as part of the design - the way a good developer improves code they're working in.
- Don't propose unrelated refactoring. Stay focused on what serves the current goal.

## After the Design

**Documentation:**

- Write the validated design (spec) to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
  - (User preferences for spec location override this default)
- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available
- Commit the design document to git
- **The spec MUST include an FRS Plan section:**
  ```markdown
  ## FRS Plan
  **MVFoS**: [slice being built]
  **Knot**: [PoW | Alpha | Beta | ...]
  **Done means**: [observable, verifiable condition]
  **Must provide**: [required deliverables]
  **Must NOT provide**: [explicitly out of scope]
  **Nice to have**: [optional extras]
  **Validation**: [commands/steps to prove done criteria]
  ```
  Missing or vague FRS criteria in the spec = spec is not complete. Fix before user review.

**Spec Self-Review:**
After writing the spec document, look at it with fresh eyes:

1. **Placeholder scan:** Any "TBD", "TODO", incomplete sections, or vague requirements? Fix them.
2. **Internal consistency:** Do any sections contradict each other? Does the architecture match the feature descriptions?
3. **Scope decomposition check:** Is this focused enough for a single implementation plan, or does it need decomposition into sub-projects first?
4. **Ambiguity check:** Could any requirement be interpreted two different ways? If so, pick one and make it explicit.
5. **FRS criteria check:** Does the spec have a complete FRS Plan section? Are done criteria observable and verifiable (not just "code is written")? Are must-not items explicitly listed? Is validation defined with specific commands?

Fix any issues inline. No need to re-review — just fix and move on.

**User Review Gate:**
After the spec review loop passes, ask the user to review the written spec before proceeding:

> "Spec written and committed to `<path>`. Please review it and let me know if you want to make any changes before we start writing out the implementation plan."

Wait for the user's response. If they request changes, make them and re-run the spec review loop. Only proceed once the user approves.

**Implementation:**

- Invoke the writing-plans skill to create a detailed implementation plan
- Do NOT invoke any other skill. writing-plans is the next step.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

## Visual Companion

A pi-native companion for showing mockups, diagrams, and visual options during brainstorming. Accepting the companion means it's available for questions that benefit from visual treatment; it does NOT mean every question goes through a visual preview.

**Offering the companion:** When you anticipate that upcoming questions will involve visual content (mockups, layouts, diagrams), offer it once for consent:
> "Some of what we're working on might be easier to explain if I can show it to you directly in pi with visual previews and comparison choices. I can put together mockups, diagrams, comparisons, and other visuals as we go. Want to use that when helpful?"

**This offer MUST be its own message.** Do not combine it with clarifying questions, context summaries, or any other content. Wait for the user's response before continuing. If they decline, proceed with text-only brainstorming.

**Per-question decision:** Even after the user accepts, decide FOR EACH QUESTION whether to use a visual preview or plain text. The test: **would the user understand this better by seeing it than reading it?**

- **Use a visual preview** for content that IS visual — mockups, wireframes, layout comparisons, architecture diagrams, side-by-side visual designs
- **Use plain chat** for content that is text — requirements questions, conceptual choices, tradeoff lists, scope decisions

If they agree to the companion, read the detailed guide before proceeding:
